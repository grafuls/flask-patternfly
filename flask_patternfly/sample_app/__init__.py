# Welcome to the Flask-Bootstrap sample application. This will give you a
# guided tour around creating an application using Flask-Bootstrap.
#
# To run this application yourself, please install its requirements first:
#
#   $ pip install -r sample_app/requirements.txt
#
# Then, you can actually run the application.
#
#   $ flask --app=sample_app dev
#
# Afterwards, point your browser to http://localhost:5000, then check out the
# source.

    # in detail inside the Flask docs:
    # http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appfactories/

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.secret_key = "devkey"

    # Our application uses blueprints as well; these go well with the
    # application factory. We already imported the blueprint, now we just need
    # to register it:
    app.register_blueprint(frontend)
